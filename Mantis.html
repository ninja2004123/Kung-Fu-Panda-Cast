                Over here! Look down! gosh I know I am tiny but
                I'm sure you can see me.
                <br>
                <br>
                Okay, I won't take much of your time,
                I and plus four of my friends are part of a Kung Fu group called
                "The Furious Five". I'm sure you might know who we are, and what we do
                but one thing I am sure you don't know is how we met.
                <br>
                Now I am not sure at all the details, but as far as I know, Shifu got
                really sick, and before I became a Kung Fu warrior, I was a "doctor".
                Well not quite, Shifu was actually my first patient, that was when I
                was still learning the art of acupuncture. yes acupuncture, the way
                to fix a human body with painfully, I mean totaly painless needles :)
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyways, once I failed to heal Shifu, I was on my way out, when I saw
                this group of four "warriors" approaching us (Shifu, Oogway and I).
                Once they got to us, the tall tigar lady said "and the doctor! Here
                are all the warriors you asked for Master!". I was confused. But knowing
                I was not a good doctor, I joined the team, together defeated Boar, impressed
                Shifu, and slowely started to master the Mantis Kunf Fu Style.
                <br>
                Thank you for listening, this was my part of the story!
