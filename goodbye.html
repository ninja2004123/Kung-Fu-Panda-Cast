        <p> All good things, must come to an end!
            And like all good things, this is the end of
            my first webpage. Before I send u home, how
            did you like that last question huh?
            <br>
            Ha ha, You didn't really think I would make the question
            that easy huh? But I am not that evil too. Between you
            and me, <b><i> every answer was correct :) </i> </b>
            shhh! don't tell anyone!
            <br>
            <br>So, back to saying goodbye! I really hope you enjoyed
            your visit on my page, and hope you learned something!
            <br>
            And If you haven't I highly suggest you check out the movie
            series, they are amazing!

            <br>
