            <p>
                Well, well, you made it to me. I wasn't expecting you to stay,
                I taught you were going to quit.
                <br>
                Ok, so since you are here, I might as well tell you my story.
                I'm guessing my teammates told you their stories, I bet that you
                are confused why was I sent to get a cleaner, a comediant, a dancer 
                and a doctor. Well I don't know either. 
                <br>
                <br>
                One day, after practicing hard with Master Shifu, there was a serious
                threat to the Valley of Peace. His name was Boar. So Master Shifu like
                the most powerful Master in China, he was going to fight Boar.
                However, some idiot poisoned him with noodels, I know, you don't see that
                everyday.
                <br>
                So I insisted to fight Boar, but Shifu didn't think I was ready so he sent
                me to get four warriors. So I ran out, on the way I bumped into this bug
                that turned out to be the doctor, one of the warriors we needed. After which
                I dropped the list, but I swear, after some bouncing I finally got it back!
                <br>
                So I went on the mission, first recruited the cleaner, then the comediant,
                the dancer, and finally the doctor. I must say Shifu was very dissapointed.
                My idea was to make my master Proud, insted I made the opposite!
                <br>
                <br>
                But I was not going to quit there, I decited to fight this Boar, which
                actually ended very well! My new team came to help, and we defeated him!
                <br>
                <br>
                After that, Shifu was proud of us, and decited to start helping us
                perfect our own styles of fighting.

                <br>
                <br>
                Since then I worked hard everyday, to find out that some fat panda that will fall
                from the sky will take my place as the Dragon warrior...
