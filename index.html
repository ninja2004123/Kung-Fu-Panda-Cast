            <h1> Hello, world!</h1>



            <h2> Welcome to my page</h2>

            <p> Hello, friend! If you somehow found this page, it means you
                are lucky! You will finally see my work(for free he he).
            </p>  

            <p> Anyways, my name is Nikola Kostadinov, and I am a 16 yo programmer.
                And This is a page dedicated to my favorite characters of the movie series
                "Kung Fu Panda". I know there are A LOT of characters missing, but this was a small
                project so you will have to deal with it :)  
            </p>

            <p> So if you turn your head slitly to the right, and you tilt your monitor/phone by
                180 degrees(you can also tilt your head to the left, that may work too...) you will see
                a menu, in this menu there are the so called "Furious Five", "The Dragon Warrior" and the two
                most popular masters "Master Shifu" and "Master Oogway". I added the most memorable moments(for me)
                about them in these tabs. So go ahead and read it! Learn why I love them so much
                and mby even learn something new :D. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you feel like you have done your studying for the day and you think 
                you know most of the things about these awesome characters, then skip foreword
                for the quiz! - The what?! - Yes, the quiz, I also added a quiz to this website!
                And don't worry, you can retake it 🙄, you can cheat(You know who you are...)!
            </p>


            <p>
                Okay enough chit-chat, have fun on my website and see you at the end!
