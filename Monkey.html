                Hello, up here, at the ceiling!
                <br>
                The names Monkey, I know it can get kind confusing being 
                a monkey and having a name Monkey, but it's actually very simple.
                Now I think that neithger I and you have much time so I'll get right into
                telling how I became part of the Furious Five!
                <br>
                <br>
                I am going to guess you already know that before I became
                this awesome Kunf Fu Fighter, I was a comediant!
                I used to perfore in bars, people usually liked my acts,
                they gave me free tomatos! But they didn't know how to controll
                their strength so the tomatos kinda splashed on the stage.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moveing on, so one night, after performing at a bar,
                there come these two strangers. They were asking for 
                a comediant to come at the Jade Palace, it was my lucky day!
                I said I will go with them, and us three started to go in the
                direction of a village, there we met out snake friend Viper, 
                and went on our path to the Jade Palace! I'm sure you already
                know the rest of the story.
                One thing the other warriors haven't told you, is that my 
                weapon of choice is a stick, with four arms, a stick is very easy
                to hangle.
                <br>
                <br>
                I gotta to go now, I see Po trying to get into my cookie jar, "Those are mine Pooo".
