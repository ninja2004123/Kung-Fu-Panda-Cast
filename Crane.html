            <p>
                Hey there! I see you have been listening to some stories from
                the other Masters, would you like to hear mine? Yes? 
                <br><br>
                Okay, So it all started when one day when Master Tigress came at the
                Lee Da Academy where I was worked as a cleaner there. I was
                very confused when tigress said Master Shifu was asking for the
                cleaner (And even more confused when she wanted me to fight!).
                <br>
                But when she said the Jade Palace, I saw a bright and shiny(get it?)
                future, so I decided to go! So after tigress game for me, we went to
                get Monkey, Viper, and finally Mantis! And after years of practice,
                we became the unstopable Furious Five!
                <br>
                <br>
                Now I don't know why but people usually compare me as the weakest team
                member. That is SO NOT TRUE! 
                <br>
                But anyways, I need to go now, have a nice day!
